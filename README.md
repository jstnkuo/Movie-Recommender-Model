# Movie-Recommender-Model

## Purpose
There are nearly endless types of movies out there. Even ignoring subgenres, there are 20 “main” movie genres that add up to many more when combined together.
However, what genre is the best. More importantly, which genre do audiences prefer the most? To tackle this question, we created models that both predicts a movie’s rating based on its genre combination and also which main genres tend to factor most into higher ratings. Along the way, we also created a recommendation algorithm based on movie genres and ratings.. In doing so, we hope to both create something interesting to look at and provide potential value to both movie producers and providers by informing actionable data.
